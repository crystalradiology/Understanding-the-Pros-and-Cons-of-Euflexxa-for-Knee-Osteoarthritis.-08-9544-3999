Living with knee osteoarthritis (OA) can make daily activities difficult and painful. If you're searching for non-surgical options to ease discomfort, Euflexxa may be one solution worth exploring. At Butler Medical Imaging, we provide Euflexxa injection services in Butler to help patients manage their knee pain and improve joint function safely and effectively.
Euflexxa is a hyaluronic acid injection designed to mimic the body’s natural joint fluid. It acts as a lubricant and shock absorber within the knee joint, which can reduce pain and enhance movement. In this article, we’ll break down the pros and cons of Euflexxa, so you can decide if it’s the right treatment for you.
What Is Euflexxa?
Euflexxa is a type of viscosupplementation therapy, where hyaluronic acid is injected into the knee joint. Hyaluronic acid is naturally found in healthy joints and helps with cushioning and movement. For those with osteoarthritis, the amount and quality of this fluid decrease, leading to joint stiffness and pain.
Euflexxa is typically given as a series of three weekly injections. It is approved by the TGA and has been used for many years to help people manage the discomfort of knee OA.
Pros of Euflexxa
1. Effective in Reducing Joint Pain
One of the biggest benefits of Euflexxa is its ability to reduce joint pain. Many patients experience significant relief, especially if they have early to moderate stages of osteoarthritis. The injected fluid helps cushion the joint, leading to smoother movement and less pain.
Some patients report relief lasting up to six months, reducing the need for daily pain medication or repeated steroid injections.
2. Improved Joint Function
By reducing stiffness and improving lubrication inside the knee, Euflexxa allows the joint to move more freely. This can improve mobility, walking ability, and general comfort, making everyday tasks like climbing stairs or walking the dog more manageable.
3. Non-Surgical Option
For those looking to avoid or delay surgery, Euflexxa offers a minimally invasive alternative. It can help bridge the gap between lifestyle changes, physical therapy, and more invasive procedures like knee replacement.
4. Longer-Lasting Relief
Compared to corticosteroid injections, which may offer only short-term relief, Euflexxa has the potential to provide longer-lasting benefits. Many patients feel the effects for several months after the full three-injection course is completed.
Cons of Euflexxa
1. Multiple Injections Required
Euflexxa is not a one-and-done treatment. It involves three injections spaced one week apart, which may be inconvenient for some patients. This also means three appointments with your healthcare provider, potentially requiring time off work or adjustments to your routine.
2. Possible Side Effects
Like any medical treatment, Euflexxa may cause side effects. These are usually mild but can include:
•	Swelling or pain at the injection site
•	Warmth or stiffness in the joint
•	Temporary fluid buildup in the knee
Severe allergic reactions are rare, but it’s important to discuss any concerns with your healthcare provider before beginning treatment.
3. Cost of Treatment
Without insurance, Euflexxa injections can cost a lot per course. However, many insurance plans may cover part or all of the cost. When compared to other options like over-the-counter pain relievers or physical therapy, Euflexxa may seem more expensive upfront, but for some patients, its long-term benefits make it a worthwhile investment.
